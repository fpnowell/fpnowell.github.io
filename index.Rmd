# About 
I am a PhD student at TU Berlin, working under the joint supervision of [Carlos Améndola](https://luke-amendola.appspot.com/) and [Ben Hollering](https://sites.google.com/view/benhollering) as part of the ["Combinatorial Methods for Learning Max-Linear Bayesian Networks"](https://www.combinatorial-synergies.de/projects/?elem=Combinatorial-Methods-for-Learning-Max-Linear-Bayesian-Networks) project of the "Combinatorial Synergies" DFG priority programme (SPP 2458). 

I obtained my master's degree in mathematics in 2024, also at TU Berlin. I wrote my thesis on the Gröbner walk algorithm ([pdf](nowell_master.pdf)).

My main research interests are in the areas of discrete geometry, combinatorics,  and computational algebra. More recent interests include algebraic statistics and the development of mathematical software. 

# Publications

- 

# Software 
- [Kamillo Ferry](https://kafe.dev) and I are developing the [GroebnerWalk](https://github.com/ooinaruhugh/GroebnerWalk.jl) julia package, which implements several versions of the Gröbner walk in OSCAR.
